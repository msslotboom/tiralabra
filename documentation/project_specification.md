## Project Specification

The goal of the project is to implement an algorithm that can play [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four](Connect 4). The user will be able to play against the algorithm. The algorithm can be set to different difficulty levels, corresponding to the depth-limit or the time-limit.

The program is implemented in Python. I can review projects programmed in Java as well. The code, comments and documentation are written in English, but I am also able to review projects written in Finnish.  

This project implements the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax](minimax algorithm) on the Connect 4 game. The goal of the project is to optimise the minimax algorithm using different methods, such as:
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Ordering the moves to improve pruning
- Iterative deepening with a time limit
- Use of a hashmap to store the results of previous runs during the same move 

Depending on how quickly the project progresses additional optimisations might be implemented. The minimax algorithm is chosen as it is an easy algorithm to implement, which shifts the focus more towards the optimisation of the algorithm rather than its implementation. 

The program will run in a terminal. The user will be able to select the difficulty-settings by choosing whether certain optimisations are on and what the time-limit or depth-limit of the algorithm is. 

I am in the tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti (TKT) programme.
